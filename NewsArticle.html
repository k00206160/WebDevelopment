			<h1>Big Mac launched into space lands in Essex football club - and someone tasted it</h1>

					When Colchester United's groundskeeper was doing his normal daily rounds he came across something a bit odd.

					On the floor next do one of the buildings there was a polystyrene box with a GoPro on the side. A bit unusual, but nothing too odd.


					But things got a lot weirder when he noticed there was a McDonald's Big Mac attached to the front of it.

					He turned it over and was just trying to work out what to do when the phone rang.

					YouTuber Tom Stanniland was on the other end of the line and told them they had found a burger he had launched more than 24 miles into space.

					In his bid to taste a Big Mac which had been into space he created an experiment using a weather balloon and tracker and let it off in Sheffield.

					However the tracker stopped working which meant they had no idea where it went - until the groundskeeper turned it over.

					Tom raced to Colchester and within three hours was at the Florence Park training ground ready to taste his "space burger".

					He said: "We had a tracker in the polystyrene box and we lost connection with it when it got so high.

					"It crash landed here but in the morning the groundskeeper found the box, turned it upside and we got a connection again.

					"We found it and we've just followed it."

					To complete the challenge Tom took a bite of the burger but it wasn't as tasty as the burgers which have stayed on the ground.

					He said: "It's not nice. It's drying my mouth out."

					He struggled to swallow it as it was so dry but after a lot of chewing he managed it, saying: "I've eaten a burger from space. There you are that's it. We've done it."

					Footage taken on the GoPro show the burger's incredible journey and show it went way above the clouds.

					Tom filmed his whole project and shared the video on his popular YouTube video.

					The football clubs media team shared the unusual on social media and it has been shared around the world.

					In a series of tweets, they wrote: "So as you can probably guess, the world of football isn't like any normal business at the best of times.

					"But what happened on Wednesday at # ColU took it to a whole new level. Settle in, this is worth sticking around for.

					"Sometimes in the media team, we really have to work our grey matter to come up with good content. At other times, stories just fall into your lap.
