					Scientists in southwest China's Yunnan province produced the puppy after taking a DNA sample from a seven-year-old police dog.Scientists in China have cloned what they call the "Sherlock Holmes of police dogs" in a bid to cut training times and costs.

					Scientists took DNA from a seven-year-old female named Huahuangma - who has won a series of awards for helping to crack multiple cases - and created a puppy named Kunxun.The Kunming wolfdog is China's first ever police dog clone and has adjusted well to her new environment, according to project analyst Wan Jiusheng.

					"She is friendly to humans, sociable and alert," he told Science and Technology Daily.

					He said the three-month-old puppy is not scared of the dark or unfamiliar places, and has already developed a strong sense of smell and can quickly find hidden food.
					Kunxun is said to have begun basic training for police training at Kunming Police Dog Base in Yunnan.

					After six months, she will start extensive training in drug detection, crowd control and security or evidence detection.
